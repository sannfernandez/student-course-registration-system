This student course registration system is a Python program developed as the final project for a Python programming course. 
It serves educational purposes by providing a user-friendly interface to manage and track students enrolled in different courses.

The program allows users to perform the following functions:

  Add a New Student: users can add new students to the system along with the courses they are enrolled in.
  Display Student List: users can view a comprehensive list of registered students and their corresponding enrolled courses.
  Retrieve Course Count for a Student: users can retrieve the number of courses a specific student is currently enrolled in.

The program efficiently stores student records using dictionaries, with the student's name as the key and the number of courses as the corresponding value.
